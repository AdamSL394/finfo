# Finfo

This Project is a collaborative effort bringing together multiple API keys on a single website. We are capturing the users input of year, month & day and putting this into our query url which makes a call to the Travelpayouts database on the click of the submit button. When we get the response we parse through the data and dynamically make a table containing price, return date, flight changes & where to but the tickets. When making the table we are adding a hook to a google search of where to buy the tickets so the user can simply click on the link and it will open a new tab and show them where to go. 


## Running Tests/Instructions
Open the file in  your browser (preferably google chrome) to test the code. When opening the website you will be prompt'd to sign in. Upon signing in you will find our website laid out with an option to look up stocks, flight and currency rates.  You will have the option to pin information and it will be there for you when you sign in next.
